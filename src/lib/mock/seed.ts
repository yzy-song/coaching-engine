 * Demo seed: the team's generated dataset (staff.json, observations.json,
 * attempts.json, transfer_gaps.json — seed 20260913, snapshot for the
 * 2026-09-13 submission) composed with the narrative exports the demo
 * screens read directly.
 *
 * Composition:
 * - `staffMembers` below is the dataset's 13 front-line staff (staff-001..
 *   staff-013), built by team-staff.ts. Marta (staff-014) is the console
 *   user and Fiona (staff-015) the cross-property L&D admin — neither is a
 *   floor-observation target.
 * - `seedObservations`/`seedAttempts` re-export the 22 real observations
 *   and 45 real practice attempts (team-observations.ts / team-attempts.ts);
 *   mock/db.ts seeds its store from them. Pipeline timestamps import 1:1,
 *   including the 09-06..09-10 dates — real generated data that reads as
 *   history by pitch day.
 * - transfer_gaps.json rows are served verbatim by mock/db.ts's gap,
 *   insights and recommendation derivation (team-gaps.ts).
 * - Diego keeps the legacy id "9f2c-diego" (the roster pickers and
 *   /manager/gap default to it). The staff-001 ↔ 9f2c-diego mapping lives
 *   only in team-staff.ts. `staffPwaActorStaffId` pins the staff-PWA actor
 *   for runtime practice attribution in mock/db.ts.
 * - The narrative objects below (debrief, scenarios, guest scripts, Diego's
 *   practice history and observation, the four recommendations, calibration,
 *   scoring anchor) are display copies the pages import by name. They mirror
 *   the same story the dataset rows carry: diegoScoreResult corresponds to
 *   real attempt att-005 (30 Aug), historyAug29Attempt to att-003 and
 *   historyAug26Attempt to att-002, diegoObservation to obs-001 — each with
 *   its own narrative id, kept out of the mock store.
