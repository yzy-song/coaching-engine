/** Shown the instant a manager route is requested, while the server renders it.
 *
 * Without a loading.tsx the App Router holds the OLD page on screen until the
 * server responds, with no visual change at all. The overview takes a few
 * seconds even against a warm API, because a transfer gap is computed per
 * person under that person's own permissions and there is deliberately no bulk
 * endpoint that would bypass row level security. On a cold host the first
 * request can take the best part of a minute.
 *
 * The result was a button that looked broken: people clicked it, nothing moved,
 * so they clicked again. This file is the fix. It sits inside ConsoleShell, so
 * the sidebar stays put and only the content area shows as pending.
